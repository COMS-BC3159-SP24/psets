## Submission Information

**This year for submission we are using Gradescope - you must submit to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/693842) to get credit!** Gradecope will allow for infinite submissions until the deadline and then will start marking submissions as late and will then lock 2 days after the due date. Please make sure to mark the page for each question on the written via Gradescope and only upload the requested files for the code section. Also if you are having issues with autograders make sure you didn't rename files! Submissions not following the requirements *will not be graded* so make sure to ask quesitons before the deadline!

Good luck!

## Written Assignment (20 points)

Please go to the PDF in the `written` folder for the written instructions (also available on Gradescope). Please use the provided latex template to write up your solutions and *submit the pdf output from latex to Gradescope*. Please refer to the software install guide for more information on Latex.

## Coding Assignment (20 points)

Pleease go to the README.md in the `gpu_population_dynamics` folder for the code instructions. As we cannot run autograders on GPU code, please submit your final `util.cuh` or `ipynb` file to courseworks!
